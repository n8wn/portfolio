        was born and raised in Hong Kong, where I attended the Canadian International School of Hong Kong. From an early age, I demonstrated a strong aptitude for computer science, continuously striving to develop and refine my skills over the years. In Grade 6, I won the Hong Kong Nationals for the MakeX Robotics Competition, an achievement that further fueled my passion for technology and innovation.

        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Bristol. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on industry experience, including my role as a Junior Software Engineer at Major Wellness Health. In this position, I developed API scripts to streamline and manage data from Shopify and Practice Better, integrating these platforms with Notion to enhance daily workflows. This experience allowed me to work closely with a diverse team, strengthening my interpersonal skills and deepening my understanding of professional work culture and expectations.
        
        Looking ahead, I am eager to continue advancing my software engineering career through ongoing projects and upcoming internships. I am committed to applying my skills and experiences to new challenges and opportunities, both on this platform and beyond.
